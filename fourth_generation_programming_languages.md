# Fourth Generation Programming Languages
## Higher Levels of Abstraction

Fourth Generation Languages (4GLs) are programming languages designed to provide a **higher level of abstraction** compared to earlier generations. Their main goal is to make software development **simpler, faster, and closer to human thinking**, reducing the amount of code needed to perform complex tasks.

Among fourth generation languages, two important categories stand out:
- **Object-Oriented Languages**
- **Visual Programming Languages**

---

## Object-Oriented Languages (OOP)

Object-Oriented Languages are used in **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. Unlike procedural programming, which focuses on sequences of instructions, OOP is based on **objects** and their interactions.

An **object** represents a real-world entity and combines:
- **Data** (attributes)
- **Behavior** (methods)

This approach makes programs easier to design, maintain, and extend.

## Key Concepts of Object-Oriented Programming

### Classes and Objects
A **class** is a blueprint or model that defines the characteristics and behaviors of objects.
An **object** is an instance of a class, created during **runtime** (when the program is executed).

**Example:**
- *Class*: Vehicle
- *Object*: Car

---

### Attributes
Attributes describe the **properties** of an object.

**Example (Dog class):**
- Height
- Weight
- Food

---

### Methods
Methods define what an object **can do**.

**Example (Dog class):**
- Run
- Play
- Eat

---

### Inheritance
**Inheritance** allows a class to acquire properties and methods from another class.
This promotes **code reuse** and reduces redundancy.

**Example:**
- Vehicle → Car, Motorcycle, Truck

Each subclass shares common features but can also have specific characteristics.

---

## Main Features of OOP

### Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the technique of **grouping data and methods together** within an object.
It allows internal details to be hidden, improving **security** and **maintainability**.

**Advantage:**
An object can be modified without affecting the rest of the program.

---

### Abstraction
Abstraction focuses on showing only the **essential features** of an object while hiding unnecessary details.

**Example:**
All vehicles have wheels, but the number of wheels varies depending on the type of vehicle.

---

### Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows the same method to behave differently depending on the object that uses it.

**Example:**
A method called `move()` may work differently for a car, a boat, or an airplane.

---

## Popular Object-Oriented Languages
- Java
- Python
- C++
- C#
- Ruby

---

## Visual Programming Languages (VPL)

Visual Programming Languages allow developers to create programs using a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** instead of writing text-based code.

Programs are built by:
- Dragging and dropping blocks
- Using icons, menus, and visual elements

---

### Advantages of Visual Programming
- Easier for beginners
- Reduces syntax errors
- Faster development for simple applications
- Useful in education and prototyping

Visual programming environments often include **IDEs (Integrated Development Environments)** that provide:
- Code editors
- Compilers or interpreters
- Debugging tools
- Automation features

---

### Examples of Visual Programming Languages
- Scratch
- Blockly
- LabVIEW
- Visual Basic (hybrid: visual and text-based)

---

## Conclusion

Fourth Generation Languages represent an important evolution in programming.
By using **object-oriented principles** and **visual interfaces**, they make software development more accessible, efficient, and closer to real-world logic.

These languages are widely used today in:
- Software engineering
- Education
- Game development
- Web and mobile applications
